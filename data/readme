All tables are in tsv format. In each file there is a separate column for a particular line, and also the column for a number of growth cycle. If there's a "mut_counts" in the name, it is the table with average mutation counts in a population (such files also have an additional column with a number of generation). If there isn't "mut_counts" in the name, the table contains the average fitness of a populaton.
